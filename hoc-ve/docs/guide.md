_Vẽ nhiều là cách luyện tập và trở lên giỏi hơn trong vẽ nhanh nhất._

So you want to draw manga, well you will probably get answers that direct you to Drawing on the Right Side of the brain (to "start"), Proko for anatomy, instructions to draw from life and studying realism here.

Now let me list some resources/insight that I've accrued in my journey towards your similar goal.

1.  Reuse your Resources: Lessons are not a Pass/Fail assignment, they are just simplified attempts to make subjects understandable. You may feel confident after you do a drawabox lesson, but until you can actually bring what you learned into your arsenal of tools, you will probably want to reinforce it. So get ready to go back and redo those "lessons" over and over.
    
2.  Write stuff down: Whether it's small goals for the next attempt at a subject, insight you don't want to forget, or just trying to break bad habits. Write these information so you don't lose it! I usually go check the last notes I had to see what I need to do next.
    
3.  Don't ignore studying anime: As long as you are not doodling, you can learn plenty with studying anime as a topic for just about anything (including those "fundamentals"). You may want to allocate more time/resource at learning from realism but the end goal here is to spend almost all time at stylized.
    
4.  Use the easiest technique: If you aren't exercising a specific technique, don't limit yourself to that one. For example, if you're drawing a body part that's in a difficult perspective making construction difficult, just simply don't use construction you could easily get away with just enveloping the area, using pos/neg shapes and landmarks to draw it instead.
    

Personal opinion:

1.  Construction is excellent at training muscle memory and draftsmanship. However, the initial exercises teaches you to "zoom in/focus" on marks (whether to create a straight line, ellipse, etc) and you need to break this habit.
    
2.  There is a skill at making an art look good enough, sometimes you can just bullshit it correctly (whether it's millions of ctrl + z or just getting away with a mistake), there is a lot of different ways to make a part of drawing believable, each time you successfully do it, you sort of add it to your memory and can recall what might work and get away with it.
