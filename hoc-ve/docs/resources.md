So, I made this post because I wanted to share my progress, and also post resources that would hopefully offer value to others. Along the past 3 months, I've discovered some excellent sources from learning, of which I'll list here. I'll start with the ones I'm actively using:

​

- Proko: Figure Drawing Fundamentals Class (free on Youtube!)
- Drawabox.com (free!)
    - Drawabox is a homework-based, drill-type approach to solidifying your understanding of 3d forms and construction drawing. I've since learned a lot of this stems from Scott Robertson's book, "How to Draw".
- "How to Draw", by Scott Robertson
    - One of the concept art industry gods. Taught Feng Zhu, a highly-regarded concept artist who runs a school out in Singapore. Teaches construction of man-made objects in perspective.
- Moderndayjames
    - Simplifies and condenses many concept art fundamentals, as well as general fundamentals of all illustration. His "Perspective" series is all ripped straight from Scott Robertson's "How to Draw", but makes it much easier to understand visually. Highly recommended!

Now, for more resources:

Alright, that's all from me. Hopefully some people can find this of value. I plan to work my way through everything as I go on, and eventually be a kick-butt illustrator making my own comic books and children's books. The wealth of information out there is just incredible. It's super exciting that we can all go find resources like this for ourselves, and act on it. I'm confident that all of these resources is enough to counter any sort of private art university.

All it takes is sitting down, and drawing.

Thanks for your time, guys!
