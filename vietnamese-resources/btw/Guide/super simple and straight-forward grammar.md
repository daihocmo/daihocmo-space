_Văn phạm tiếng Viêt_ (Vietnamese grammar) is pretty simple. When it comes to verb tenses and conjugations, it’s like a piece of cake. Guess what? There are **NO VERB CONJUGATIONS** (_Không chia động từ)_ in the verb, no matter of what tenses! No such thing like regular or irregular verbs that you have to worry about. Singular or plural, first person, second person, or third person, affirmative or negative, the **_động từ (verb)_ doesn’t change its form whatsoever**. No sweat. It’s so easy, right?

Now you may wonder if there are no conjugations, then how to indicate different tenses? Easy peasy, all you need to do is adding an indicator word in front of the **_động từ (verb)_** . Here is the general basic structure:

**Subject** **(S) + [Tense indicator word]** **+ Verb** **(V) + Object** **(O)**

Major tenses that you see in the Vietnamese sentence structure are the simple present, the continuous present, the simple past, and the future tense. Again, whatever tense it is, the verb itself doesn’t change. The trick is to find the right tense indicator word and add it in front of the verb or adding another adverb in the sentence to further clarify the tense.

## **PRESENT TENSE**

1.  **Simple present tense:** It is the easiest one because you don’t have to add any tense indicators. Follow this structure:

S + V + O

- Example: _Tôi (S) là (V) giáo viên (O)_ (I am a teacher)

Adverbs (A) like _thường_ (often), _mỗi_ (each), _hằng_ (every) often use in the simple present tense to indicate the habitual or routine. In that case, the structure is

S+ A + V + O

Examples:

- _Chúng_ _tôi (S)_ _thường (A)_ _gặp (V)_ _ngày chủ nhật (O)_ (We often meet on Sunday)

2. **Present continuous tense:** All you need to do is adding the word **_đang_** in front of the verb.

S + **_đang_** + V + O

- Example: _Tôi_ _(S) **đang** đi  (V) **bộ**_  (O) (I am walking)

3. **Present perfect & present perfect continuous:** Ether treat it as the simple present, or simple past tense by adding the word **_đã_** in front of the verb.

S + [**_đã_**]+ V + O

Examples

- Present perfect: _Chị_ _ấy (S) [_**_đã_**_]_ _sống (V)_ _ở đây hơn ba năm rồi (O)_ (She has lived here more than three years already).
- Present perfect continuous: _Chúng nó (S)_ _[_**_đã_**_] đi (V)_ _bộ hơn 3 tiếng (O)_ (They have been walking for more than 3 hours).

Note that you could omit adding the word **_đã_** here.

## **PAST TENSE**

1. **Simple past tense**, add the indicator word **_đã_** in front of the verb.

S + **_đã_** + V + O

2. **Past continuous, past perfect, and past perfect continuous:** Treat as simple past tense.

Examples:

- Past continuous: _Anh_ _ấy (S)_ **_đã_** _ngồi (V) ở cái ghế này (O)_ (He was sitting in this chair)
- Past perfect: _Anh_ _ấy (S)_ **_đã_** _ở (V) đây hơn 2 tiếng (O)_ (He had been here for more than 2 hours)
- Past perfect continuous: _Anh_ _ấy (S)_ **_đã_** _đứng (V) đây lâu lắm rồi (O)_ (He had been standing here for a long time)

## **FUTURE TENSES**

1. **Simple Future**: Add the indicator word **_sẽ_** in front of the verb.

S+ **_sẽ_** + V+ O

2. **Future continuous, future perfect, and future perfect** **continuous:** Treat as simple future tense.

Examples:

- Future continuous: _Anh_ _ấy (S)_ **_sẽ_** _ngồi (V) ở cái ghế này (O)_ (He will be sitting in this chair)
- Future perfect: _Anh_ _ấy (S)_ **_sẽ_** _ăn (V) món này (O)_ (He will have eaten this dish)
- Future perfect continuous: _Anh_ _ấy (S)_ **_sẽ_** _đứng (V) tại đây (O)_ (He will have been standing right here)

**SUMMARY**

In general, the verb itself is never change, just do nothing for the present tense, add the word **_đang_** for continuous tense, **_đã_** for past tense, and **_sẽ_** for future tense in front of the verb.
