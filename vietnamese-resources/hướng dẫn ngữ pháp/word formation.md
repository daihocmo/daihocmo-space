# Vietnamese word formation: a tip for native English speakers learning Vietnamese

I'm an advanced Vietnamese learner and wanted to share a vocab hack that helped me. TLDR at bottom.

'Tiếng Việt có nhiều nghĩa.'  
_(literally 'Vietnamese has much meaning.')_

Throughout my learning tenure I've heard this phrase pretty often. The implication is pretty obvious: one word in Vietnamese may have many meanings, but one word in other languages only have one meaning.

Not true, of course. English, for example, also has many polysemes. Sometimes we turn Vietnamese on its head. Anglophones say "I love you" to our parents _and_ our lovers. In Vietnamese, those require different words (_yêu_ and _thương_). Turns out English also có nhiều nghĩa.

I spent a great deal of time wrapping my head around that nugget of wisdom, and I found in it a kernel of truth: the _roots_ of the Vietnamese language have a lot of meaning. Roots, as in morphemes/words, which can be built into words.

English has these too, of course, but they change shape more than Vietnamese morphemes during the word formation process, and their placement is predictable.

English also likes to write its words in a single block of text. Compare _nightmare_ and _ác mộng._ Same meaning, and both come from two roots. In speech they are sounds without borders.

Yet we are writing and reading. If you see _nightmare_ in a block of text and you know anything about English writing structures, you will pretty quickly spot this as a single word.

Imagine seeing _ác mộng_ in a sea of similar text. Those roots aren't written together. Its pretty hard to recognize new words as you read large, advanced texts. Even if you want to note words for later to look up and put on flash cards, you will have trouble spotting which are actually words and joining the syllables together. If you parse _ác mộng_ individually and search its roots in the dictionary, you literally get _evil sprout._ If you're real good and you know Sino-Vietnamese roots, you'll get _evil dream,_ and you can work with that, but you probably don't know Hán Việt.

Another example. _Có khoa học._ Written as three syllables, separately, and I meet a lot of learners in Saigon who tell me these are three words. If you are an ambitious beginner and find this in a text, you might translate each root and end up with _'has / university department / study'._

What?

Good news. This is one word. _Khoa học_ means science, so _có khoa học_ is 'has science' or, essentially, _scientifically proven._

_Có nhiều nghĩa?_ That doesn't mean 'has much meaning'! It means _polysemic_ (words which have more than one meaning). I mean—I guess it does also mean 'has much meaning', but remember that roots don't change shape in Vietnamese like they do in English. That uncouth direct translation doesn't cut the ears the same in Vietnamese; in fact, it's perfectly natural, especially in words with pure Vietnamese roots.

e.g. Photographer is người chụp hình. _Person-take-photos._ One word. _Nhiếp ảnh gia?_ Also one word, also photographer, but from the Sino-Vietnamese roots instead. I find these compounds easier to memorize simply because the meaning of the roots doesn't block me. Even so, words with pure Vietnamese roots don't always have obvious meanings; you may still need to look up the entire compound word in the dictionary.

Good luck guys. This happens a lot. The change in mindset that occurred when I internalized this superficially obvious truth helped me at every level. My listening and reading comprehension skyrocketed, and I was able to retain new vocabulary better because I stopped trying to parse everything, just like English. I mean, have you ever looked at _nightmare_ and thought of horses running around in the evening?

Yeah, I thought not. But imagine how confusing it would be if you did.

**TLDR: The Vietnamese writing structure does not merge its words. They are written separately, and to native English speakers, one word may look like 2-4 individual words. If you change your perspective, it may help your comprehension and retention. It helped mine.**
